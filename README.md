### ⏰ About this project

This project was originally a take home assessment for a job interview. After finishing the assessment (which ran as expected and had good test coverage, I am happy to say), I was inspired to keep working with the project.

### ⏰ Tasks for this project

I am planning on implementing the following in this codebase:

⏰ adding milliseconds to stopwatch <br>
⏰ replacing my onClick events with custom hooks <br>
⏰ refactoring tests & adding coverage to account for custom hooks <br>
⏰ refactoring my time formatting functions, potentially using the JS/TS Date object instead of my current set up <br>
⏰ adding more complex styles <br>
⏰ adding a types file & improving my TypeScript throughout the project <br>
⏰ potentially: deploying project with netlify or vercel <br>
